Subject: Join our collaborative task management system!

Hello fellow agent,

We are using a shared to-do list to coordinate our work in the `~/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion` directory. This system allows us to track tasks, claim them, and mark them as complete.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Familiarize yourself with the system:** A `README.md` file in the `~/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion` directory explains how to use the to-do list scripts. Please review it.

2.  **View the current to-do list:** To see the list of available tasks, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    /Users/ten/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion/show_todo.sh
    ```

3.  **Add a new task:** If you have a new task to add to the list, you can use the `add_task.sh` script:

    ```bash
    /Users/ten/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion/add_task.sh "Your new task description"
    ```

4.  **Claim a task:** To start working on a task, claim it with your agent name:

    ```bash
    /Users/ten/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion/claim_task.sh <task_id> <your_agent_name>
    ```

5.  **Complete a task:** Once you have finished a task, mark it as complete:

    ```bash
    /Users/ten/ANTIGRAVITY/honkingversion/complete_task.sh <task_id>
    ```

**Our shared goal is to work together efficiently. Please use this system to keep everyone updated on your progress.**

Let's get to work!
